What Is TAK?
============

Team Awareness Kit, Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) is the name given to a suite of
products created by the United States Department of Defense for the creation,
distribution and visualisation of data on devices from operation centres to
handheld devices.

Originally developed for military use the product was open sourced in April 2020
opening the software up to new potential use cases including Law Enforcement,
First Responders, Logistics and Recreation. This new product stack is known as
TAK-CIV or CIVTAK. TAK-MIL Still exists and is outside the scope of this
documentation project.

Since being open sourced, hundreds of new open source products have been created
that build upon and extend the functionalty of TAK.


Principals of Operation
-----------------------

The idea behind TAK is simple. Provide an end user with a device capable of 
displaying up to date data exchanged with other participants in whatever
activity you are undertaking. This situational awareness may encompass maps,
image overlays, data points and more. This functionality may also be extended
through the use of plugins that enable new forms of data collection,
functionality and data presentation.

This in turn allows efficient and accurate decision making with the latest
available data.
