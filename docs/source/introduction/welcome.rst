Welcome

Thanks for checking out the unofficial takserver documentation. This project was
started address the documentation problem that comes with using TAK. While the
documentation provided by the TAK Product Centre is adequate to get up and
running with a TAK deployment there isn't much substance beyond the basics.
That's a problem I had when first getting my bearings with TAK. I often found
myself reading the source code, chat history logs and blogs prompting 
you to run some random script that never actually explained what configuration
was being applied. This coupled with the fragmented nature of the information
has compelled me to produce some properly written documentation.

.. warning::
    Do not run random scripts without reading and understanding them first.
